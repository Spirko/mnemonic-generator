# mnemonic-generator
For a template of several small tokens of letters, find a set of words that acts as a mnemonic for the tokens.

As an example, the cross product in 3-D can be defined as:

$$ \begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\\\ c \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix}d \\\\ e \\\\ f \end{pmatrix} =
   \begin{pmatrix} bf - ce \\\\ cd - af \\\\ ae - bd \end{pmatrix} $$
   
The goal is to shuffle the letters to form words.
